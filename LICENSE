              TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Commercial use is prohibited without direct
   reference to creator, and/or a fraction of
   profits going to said creator.

1. This is free to use for other uses, however
   if there is a direct correlation between
   licensed software, then reference to creator
   is required.

2. Feel free to use licensed software as an
   educational tool, for research, or for
   improving a section of something you're
   working on. These do not need any reference
   unless you really have to.

3. â˜• Have a cuppa tea, and do what you like.
   if you're not aiming to make money using
   software licensed under the notyright
   license, then you have nothing to worry about.
   After all, I have no idea what I am doing,
   and if something about this isn't legally
   viable, or if something doesn't match up,
   then contact the email at line 5 of this license.
